# Bay_of_Fundy
Assorted code from 2021 internship for simulated and observational drifter data extraction and analysis.


## Module Library

### Data Extraction/Visualizations
#### drifter_functions_2021.py
- Information: A collection of functions to extract observational drifter data from ERDDAP, plot the drifter on googlemaps and basemap.


#### FVCOM_uvmodel.py
- Information: A collection of functions for visualizing FVCOM velocity fields, with tidal inputs and detided.

#### ROMS_uvmodel.py
- Information: Inspired by PICO github, uvmodel.py and Rich Signell's blog. Still working on binned and detided data processing.



### Simulated Drifters
#### particle_tracking_routine
- Information: Using code from oceanparcels ipynb examples as posted on oceanparcels github.
  
  
  
### Data Analysis/Statistics
- to be updated
